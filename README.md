# Staff of Trolling
Adds in a hotkey to use a fake staff of travelling, effectively giving you a
free staff of travelling that you don't need to dedicate a slot to.

Also adds in the command `packetTeleport` that works basically like `/tp` but
doesn't need op. Also can't tp to players because you're client is telling the
server where to tp and you wouldn't know where someone outside of render
distance is.
